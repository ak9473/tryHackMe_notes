Firewall is a software or hardware that monitors the network traffic and compares it against a set of rules before passing or blocking it
-basic firewall should inspect: Protocol, Source Address and Destination Address
-Protocols: TCP, UDP, ICMP
-TCP or UDP: source port number and destination port number

Telnet TCP: 23
HTTPS TCP: 443
TCP HTTP Alternate: 8080
SNMPSSH: 5161

Types of Firewalls
1. Hardware Firewall: network traffic goes through ex. Cisco ASA, WatchGuard Firebox, Netgate pfSense Plus appliance
2. Software Firewall: software that comes bundled with the OS or as an additional service

1. Personal firewall: protect single system
2. Commercial firewall: protect medium to large networks - higher reliability and processing power

Firewall types: 
1. Packet-filtering firewall: most basic type - inspect protocol, source and destination IP addresses and ports in TCP and UDP datagrams
2. Circuit-level Gateway: In addition to packet-filtering can provide TCP three-way handshake 
3. Stateful Inspect Firewall: keeps track of established TCP sessions block packets outside of established TCP sessions
4. Proxy Firewall: check contents of a packet paylload instead of packet headers
5. Next-Generation Firewall: highest firewall protection from OSI Layer 2 to OSI Layer 7
6. Cloud Firewall: firewall as a service, replace hardware firewall in a cloud environment

Evasion via Controlling the source MAC/IP/Port

Nmap allows: Decoys, Proxy, Spoofed Mac Address, Spoofed Source IP, Fixed Source Port Number

-Pn: force scan even if no ping reply is received
-Pn: skip host discovery and testing whether the host is live = spped up scan, limit to 100 most common ports with -F
nmap -sS -Pn -F [Machine IP]
caputred using WireShark

-Decoys
-hide scan with decoys - mix IP address with other decoy IP addresses
-D option
nmap -sS -Pn -D RND,RND,ME - F [Machine IP]

-Proxy
-use an HTTP/SOCKS4 proxy
'--proxies PROXY_URL' option
nmap -sS -Pn --proxies [spoofIP] [machineIP]

-Spoofed Mac Address
-spoof mac address
'--spoof-mac MAC_ADDRESS'
-spoofing works if the system is on the same network segment as the target host
